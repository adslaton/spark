  "readme": "# Cylon.js For Spark\n\nCylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js\n\nThis module provides an adaptor for the Spark core device using either the built-in Tinker protocol (https://www.spark.io/), or else [VoodooSpark](https://github.com/voodootikigod/voodoospark) from [@voodootikigod](https://github.com/voodootikigod). The VoodooSpark implementation uses the [Spark-IO](https://github.com/rwaldron/spark-io) node module from [@rwaldron](https://github.com/rwaldron/). Thank you! \n\nWant to use Ruby on robots? Check out our sister project Artoo (http://artoo.io)\n\nWant to use the Go programming language to power your robots? Check out our sister project Gobot (http://gobot.io).\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-spark.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-spark)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall the module with: `npm install cylon-spark`\n\nYou'll need your `access_token` and `device_id` to push new software to your\nSpark, and you can get both of these from Spark's [Build\ntool](https://spark.io/build).\n\n- **access_token:** In the Build tool, click on the Settings cog in the\n  bottom-left corner to find your access token.\n- **device_id:** After you have your Spark Core registered to your account\n  through the Tinker app, click on the Cores section (just above the Settings\n  cog) on the Build tool. Then, click on the arrow next to your core's name to\n  get its device ID.\n\n## Installing Firmware On Your Spark Core\n\nYou will need to install the appropriate firmware on your Spark Core to use it from Cylon.js. \n\nOne option is to use the Tinker software, which has the same API as the \"default.cpp\" code that is included with the Gort CLI (http://gort.io). This routes all of your calls thru the Spark cloud, with is appropriate for communicating with Spark devices in a remote location.\n\nAnother option is to use the VoodooSpark firmware, which has its own binary API. This discovers your device thru the Spark cloud, and then routes all of your calls directly to the Spark Core device. This is appropriate for communicating with Spark devices on the same local subnet as the computer that you wish to control them from.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Spark using Tinker API:\n```javascript\nvar Cylon = require('cylon');\n\n// Initialize the robot\nCylon.robot({\n  connection: { name: 'spark', adaptor: 'spark', accessToken: 'XYZPDQ123', deviceId: '123ABC456' },\n  device: {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D0'},\n\n  work: function(my) {\n    every((1).second(), function() {my.led.toggle()});\n  }\n}).start();\n```\n### Spark using VoodooSpark API:\n```javascript\nvar Cylon = require('cylon');\n\n// Initialize the robot\nCylon.robot({\n  connection: { name: 'voodoospark', adaptor: 'voodoospark', accessToken: 'XYZPDQ123', deviceId: '123ABC456', module: 'spark' },\n  device: {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D0'},\n\n  work: function(my) {\n    every((1).second(), function() {my.led.toggle()});\n  }\n}).start();\n```\n\n## Documentation\nWe're busy adding documentation to our web site at http://cylonjs.com/ please check there as we continue to work on Cylon.js\n\nThank you!\n\n## Contributing\n\n* All patches must be provided under the Apache 2.0 License\n* Please use the -s option in git to \"sign off\" that the commit is your work and you are providing it under the Apache 2.0 License\n* Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.\n* We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.\n* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.\n* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.\n* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality & Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n* All pull requests should be \"fast forward\"\n  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”\n  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”\n  * For git help see [progit](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an awesome (and free) book on git\n\n## Release History\n\nVersion 0.8.0 - Compatibility with Cylon 0.14.0, remove node-namespace.\n\nVersion 0.7.0 - Release for cylon 0.12.0\n\nVersion 0.6.0 - Release for cylon 0.11.2, Add support for server side events, user defined functions, variables and a firmware upload cli command\n\nVersion 0.5.0 - Release for cylon 0.11.0, refactor into pure JavaScript\n\nVersion 0.4.0 - Release for cylon 0.10.0\n\nVersion 0.3.0 - Release for cylon 0.9.0\n\nVersion 0.2.0 - Release for cylon 0.8.0\n\nVersion 0.1.0 - Initial release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 The Hybrid Group.
